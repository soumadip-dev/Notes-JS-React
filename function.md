## First-Class Functions

In JavaScript, functions are considered **first-class citizens**, meaning:

- We can **return** a function from another function.
- We can **pass** a function as an argument to another function.
- We can **store** a function in a variable.
- Functions are treated as **objects** and have associated methods, such as `call`, `apply`, and `bind`.

### Notes on Call Stack and Return Values

- Every entry created inside the call stack by a function call is called a **stack frame**.
- If a function does not explicitly return a value, JavaScript automatically returns `**undefined**`.

---

### Passing Values to Functions

- **Primitive Values**: When a **primitive value** (such as a number, string, or boolean) is passed to a function, the function receives a **copy** of that value. Changes made inside the function do **not** affect the original value.

- **Objects**: When an **object** (or array) is passed, the function receives a **reference** to the object. Changes to the object's properties inside the function **will** affect the original object. However, this is not true "pass by reference"â€”the reference itself is passed by value.

## Function Expressions

A function expression is created when the first valid token is not the `function` keyword.

```javascript
const myFun = function fun(x) {
    console.log("calling...", x);
};
myFun(10); // We can simply use the variable name and pass the required arguments in a pair of parentheses.
```

### Types of Function Expressions

#### Named Function Expression

A function expression with a name attached to it is called a named function expression.

```javascript
const myFun = function fun(x) {
    console.log("calling...", x);
};
```

Here, `fun` is the name of the function expression, and this function expression is stored in a variable `myFun`.

#### Anonymous Function Expression

A function expression without a name attached to it is called an anonymous function expression.

```javascript
const myFun = function (x) {
    console.log("calling...", x);
};
```

Here, the function expression has no name, and this function expression is stored in a variable called `myFun`.

#### Arrow Function Expression

- An arrow function expression is a more concise way to write function expressions using the `=>` syntax.
- One fundamental difference between arrow functions and other function expressions is that in arrow functions, the `this` keyword is resolved lexically, whereas in other function expressions, the `this` keyword is resolved by the call site.

```javascript
const cube = (x) => {
    return x ** 3;
};
```

- In the code below, the only thing `square` is expected to do is return `x * x`; for an arrow function, we don't need to write the `return` keyword.

```javascript
const square = (x) => x * x; // Implicit return
```

- If the arrow function takes only a single argument, then parentheses are not mandatory.

```javascript
const square = x => x * x;
```

- If there is more than one or no argument, then parentheses are required.
- If we try to return an object, we need to put the object inside parentheses.

```javascript
const fun = () => ({ username: "Soumadip" });
```

- Example of using an arrow function in `map` for an array:

```javascript
arr.map(x => x * x);
```

#### Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

- A function expression that is called the moment it is defined is called an IIFE.
- To define an IIFE, we first wrap a function inside a pair of parentheses and then immediately call the function by putting a subsequent pair of parentheses and passing arguments inside it.

```javascript
(function fun(x) {
    console.log("calling...", x);
})(10);

//Another example with arrow function
((x)=> console.log("calling...", x))(10);
```

- Here, the function `fun` is defined and immediately invoked with the argument `10`. The result is that "calling... 10" is logged to the console.
- Once we have executed the IIFE, it is wiped from memory because IIFE is used only once.
- IIFE can be very useful to avoid name conflicts because they don't interfere with variables in outer scopes. They can also be useful for temporary logic.

#### Function Expression as a Callback

Function expressions can also be passed as arguments to other functions, often used as callbacks.

```javascript
setTimeout(function (x) {
    console.log("calling after delay...", x);
}, 1000, 10);
```

Here, an anonymous function expression is passed as a callback to the `setTimeout` function, which will execute it after a delay of 1 second with the argument `10`.

### Named vs. Anonymous Function Expressions

- **Readability:** Named function expressions improve the readability of the code. Anonymous function expressions require reading the whole logic to understand what they do.
- **Debugging:** Anonymous functions are hard to debug because, in the call stack, they do not have a name.

```javascript
function fun(fn) {
    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    fn(arr);
}

fun(function gun(arr) {
    console.trace("call stack"); // This function prints the call stack in the console
});
```

Output:
```
call stack
gun @ VM232:7
fun @ VM232:3
(anonymous) @ VM232:6
```

- **Recursion:** Named function expressions can be easily integrated into a recursive environment, whereas anonymous functions are hard to use in recursion.
- **Anonymous function expressions** are useful when:
  - The code logic is simple.
  - We are storing the anonymous function expression in a variable, and that variable explains most of the logic of the function expression.
